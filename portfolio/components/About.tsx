            My journey into <span className='text-textLightGold'>software development</span> began with something that lights up the eyes of many: <span className='text-textLightGold'>video games</span>. As a kid, I was captivated by the magic of games â€“ the way they transported me to other worlds. Little did I know, this fascination would become the foundation of my career. From hours spent playing, my curiosity shifted towards how these games were created. This led me to explore coding, diving into languages like Python and C++.

            During my <span className='text-textLightGold'>co-op</span> at Infocrush Consulting, I crafted an interactive puzzle game, blending graphics, sounds, and scripts seamlessly. As a <span className='text-textLightGold'>Freelance</span> gig with Unadio, I fused design finesse with Python skills, elevating user experiences. <span className='text-textLightGold'>University projects</span> displayed my prowess in melding data and tech, while an AR Project stood as a pinnacle, fusing augmented reality and audiobooks into innovation.
